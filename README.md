With an interactive and dynamic interface, the platform records and analyzes user responses, offering valuable lifetime insights. Additionally, the integration of local storage ensures a seamless experience for all users, enabling the tracking of responses even for those without accounts. 10 Questions transforms medical education into a captivating daily challenge, fostering continuous improvement and inclusivity in diagnostic skills.
